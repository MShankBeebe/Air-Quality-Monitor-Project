# Air Quality Monitor Project

I live in an area that frequently has problems with wildfire smoke and gets a lot of air quality alerts.  I thought it would be useful to make an air quality monitor.
I am still learning Circuit Python, electronics, and how to work with Raspberry Pi Pico/Pico W, so this will be an ongoing project that I will update as I go.  I will be adding instructions
and links to additional resources for any other curious people who would like to build their own air monitor and/or learn with me.
My goal is eventually to have something that will measure C02, VOCs, and PM 2.5 particles and transfer the data wirelessly.

The Rasberri Pi Foundation has wonderful documentation for the Pico and Pico W boards here:

For quick reference, I have reproduced their Pinout Diagram here.  A larger better one is available as a PDF from the link above.
